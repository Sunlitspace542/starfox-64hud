# Star Fox mug converter / foxchr

These command line tools will convert a 24bit PNG into the correct SNES 4pbb format.

The PNG must be 40 pixels tall, and a multiple of 32 pixels wide. Use superfamiconv to convert the PNG into SNES 4bpp format.

Then use foxchr to convert the SNES 4bpp image from horizontal alignment into vertical alignment.

The included ``make_FACE.bat`` file does this for you.

The source code to foxchr is included in the zip file.
