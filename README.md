# UltraStarFox
Star Fox / Starwing (SNES 1993) source code, modified for ease-of-use and ROMHacking.

## Features

- SuperFX 21Mhz support
- FastROM (A bug with the SD2SNES/FXPak Pro causes freezes and crashes on SHVC revisions of the SNES)
- Lots of free bank space for new models, assets and code
- 256 texture slots
- 250 Faces/Vertices limit
- Bugfixes and improvements
- Uses ARGLINK from Star Fox 2 as linker instead of SL
- Color palette data, MSPRITES, and crunched (compressed) graphics rebuilt at assembly
- Easier creation of wireframe models (replace face3 and face4 with aface3 and aface4 in the shape file)
- All Starwing PAL and Germany text/GFX for PAL builds
- SNES Mouse support
- MSU-1 support (Original ASM patch by Kurrono, ported by Kando and Sunlit)
- Very configurable, see SF\CONFIG\CONFIG.INC for more info
- Kando was involved so you know it's good

## Building on Windows

Requirements: Microsoft Windows

Download repo as ZIP and extract somewhere, or clone the repo with git via the command line.  

To build ROM, run ``build.cmd``.  

To build ROM with Logging, run ``build to log.cmd``.  

To clean, run ``clean.cmd``.  

After building, a debug symbol map will be created at ``SYMBOLS.TXT``.

## Building on Linux

**NOTE: this was tested on WSL with Ubuntu installed. Your mileage may vary.**  

Requirements: Ubuntu (might work with other distros) snap, DOSBox-X, git  

Install snapstore: ``sudo apt install snapd``  

Install DOSBOX-X from snap: ``sudo snap install dosbox-x``  

Clone repository: ``git clone https://github.com/Sunlitspace542/ultrastarfox``  

To build ROM, run ``make``.  

To build ROM with logging, run ``make log``.  

To clean, run ``make clean``.  

After building, a debug symbol map will be created at ``SYMBOLS.TXT``.

## TODO
1. OPTIMIZE  
2. Strip out all Super Star Fox weekend-related code  
3. Annotate and document code  
4. MAYBE: Disassemble all BIN files in SND directory, add documentation on custom music and the like
