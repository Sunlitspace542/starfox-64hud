# UltraStarFox
Star Fox / StarWing (SNES, 1993), with modifications for easier creation of ROM hacks and general ease-of-use.

## Features

- SuperFX Fast mode (21Mhz) support and various optimizations
- FastROM (A bug with the SD2SNES (FXPak Pro) causes freezes and crashes on SHVC revisions of the SNES)
- Lots of free bank space for new models, assets and code
- 256 texture slots
- 250 Faces/Vertices limit
- Bugfixes and improvements
- Uses ARGLINK from Star Fox 2 as linker instead of SL
- rebuild color palette data using the palette packer (bldpal.bat)
- Easier creation of wireframe models
- Matching text data
- Working StarWing title screen and German/PAL StarWing assets
- SNES Mouse support
- Kando was involved so you know it's good

## Building

Requirements: Microsoft Windows, DOSBox (DOSBox-X for Windows included), Python

Download repo as ZIP and extract somewhere or clone repo with git via the command line.  

to build ROM, run ``build.cmd`` (Windows) or ``BUILD.BAT`` (DOSBox)  

to build ROM with Logging, run ``build to log.cmd`` (Windows) or ``BLDtolog.BAT`` (DOSBox)  

to rebuild color palettes, run ``build palette.cmd`` (Windows) ``BLDPAL.BAT`` (DOSBox)  

the .BAT versions of these can be run via DOSBox if you do not use Windows.  

After building, a debug symbol map will be created at ``SYMBOLS.TXT``.

## TODO
1. OPTIMIZE
2. Strip out all Super Star Fox weekend-related code
3. Annotate and document code

## Maybe?
- MSU-1 support (big maybe, probably won't happen)
