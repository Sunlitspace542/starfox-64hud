                            reference errors
          x<expr >-         print the expression. (note the white space
                            after the expression.)

Extended commands I(x)
          b          -          total number of bytes(End message only)
          c          -          prints processor type
          e          -          number of errors
          f          -          number of files
          l          -          number of lines

          w          -          number of warnings


Remember a :$ before an expression will print the value in hex.

7  Expression evaluation
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Expression evaluation is done in order of precedance, if two
operators have equal precedance then they are evaluated left to right.
  This table is a list of the operators available and there
precedance(A high number means it has a high precedance).....

    Operator     Name             Action               Precedance
      >        Hi-byte      Gets the hi byte               10
      <        Lo-byte      Gets the low byte              10
      +        Unary pos    Sets the sign                   9
      -        Unary neg    Sets the sign                   9
      ~        Unary not    Nots a number                   9
      $        Sine         Gets a sine value               8
     >>        Shift right  Shifts the number right         8
     <<        Shift left   Shifts the number left          8
      >        Greater      Returns true if x>y             7
      <        Lower        Returns true if x<y             7
      =        Equal        Returns true if x=y             6
      &        Logical and  Logical ANDs two numbers        5
      ^        Logical xor  Logical XORs two numbers        4
      !        Logical or   Logical ORs two numbers         3
      |        MOD          Calculates the MOD of 1 to 2    2
      /        Divide       Divides two numbers             2
      *        Multiply     Multiplies two numbers          2
      +        Add          Adds two numbers                1
      -        Subtract     Subtracts two numbers           1

   Partially enclosing an expression in brackets will give that part
of the expression a higher priority hence 1+2*3 = 7 but (1+2)*3 = 9.

   All expressions are done with a 32 bit expression evaluator, if an
overflow occurs while performing an operator, no overflow error will
be given, however overflow errors will be given if a number is too
big ie. a hex number has more than 8 digits etc.

8  Special notes
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Hidden symbols --
 As the assembler runs it's own internal source file before including
the source file specified, it is possible to attempt to define
symbols in your source code which are the same as some defined in the
internal source, if this happens you will have to redefine your
symbol.

   There is a command hidden to the user called getheap, which will
get as much heap as specified, this is used by the assembler on
startup and shouldn't be used by the user. However GETHEAP cannot be
defined as a macro, but unless checkmac is on this error will not
be reported.

   Do not define string 5 on the command line if you have a sasmheap
enviroment variable defined as the assembler uses string 5 as a
temporary storage for the heap size in its internal source code.

   The assembler supports ASCII codes, that is characters from 0 to
127, if a character higher than 127 is used in a macro,symbol etc.
things may go very wrong!

 It is possible to use INCCOL as a CGX and SCR file includer too!
  To include a CGX file you will have to know how many chars are in
it, and to include a SCR file you will have to know how many screens
are used.  Below are some macros to include them!

; Incbin an 8 bit CGX file
inccgx8	MACRO
	inccol	<name>.cgx,0,_NUMCHRS*2
	ENDM

; Incbin a 4 bit CGX file
inccgx4	MACRO
	inccol	<name>.cgx,0,_NUMCHRS
	ENDM

; Incbin a 2 bit CGX file
inccgx2	MACRO
	inccol	<name>.cgx,0,_NUMCHRS/2
	ENDM

; Incbin a screen file
incscr	MACRO
	inccol	<name>.scr,first screen*64,_NUMSCRS*64
	ENDM

   Downloading to SFX can sometimes go wrong, if it does switch on
rom listing and note which bank goes wrong(not rom pos.), go into the
source code and put a few extra bytes at the start of the bank!
(Fixed now I think)
